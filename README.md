# MolecularDynamics - Protein Simulation-1KZY
# Why MD?

A method for studying the physical movements of atoms and molecules.
 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation combines concepts from quantum and statistical mechanics
 Molecular systems typically consist of a vast number of particles, it is impossible solve such complex systems analytically; MD simulation circumvents this problem by using numerical methods.
 MD is used in variety of fields in the industry:
Produce optimal drugs to fight harmful  microorganism
Slow down/stop cancer cells from growing.
Produce cost-effective/environmentally friendly resources
